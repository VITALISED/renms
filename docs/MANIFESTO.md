# Manifesto

## To RayRodTV and fans

This project may seem extraordinarily similar to Ray's Multiverse API, and that's because... well, when you boil it down, that's what it is. But we are making it for different reasons, with a different goal in mind. It is to our understanding that the Multiverse API is made primarily for RayRod's super-project and successor to his Overhaul, RayRod's Multiverse. Our primary goal is to be a little more like a gmod for No Man's Sky.

## End goal

We want this to end up a lot like the current state of Northstar for TitanFall 2: A completely independent steamworkshop-like mod manager that can handle every type of mod that could exist. It is also here to provide a more capable modding solution to No Man's Sky then what currently exists; metadata modding. We also want to make a sort of multiplayer mod client for No Man's Sky, of which VITALISED will need to add more detail here because I (tractorbeam) am still a little fuzzy on the details.

### The *real* ***REAL*** reason this exists (for legal reasons, this is satire, it's an inside joke, please don't sue us lol)

It's because Fuck You NexusMods, you piece of shit, account-requiring, wait-five-seconds-my-ass, ad filled piece of virus risking spyware. You are the Fandom of mod websites. Fuck you.
