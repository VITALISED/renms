#include "HostPropertySet.h"


/**
 * \brief Custom inner property set interface.
 * 
 * The Object Store contains named lists, and those named lists each contains a vector of inner property sets.
 * 
 * For example, you can create a list named "Property curve points" and have 12 inner property sets with coordinates,
 * configuration and information for the 12 user-created curve points.
 * 
 * Inner property sets can be created from any inner types, as defined in the plug-in's XML definition file
 * <code>InnerTypes</code> section. Your lists should contain recognizable types, as there is no way to poll the
 * type of the created object. This system was created with a one-list-one-type design pattern; however, there is
 * no actual restriction in using different types in a same list.
 * 
 * You can define as many named lists as required. You should consider creating different inner property sets or
 * lists for each platform if the property set indexes aren't linked.
 * 
 * You can create new inner property set with \ref CreatePropertySet, and insert it in a list's index with
 * \ref InsertPropertySet.
 * 
 * You can also subscribe to notifications through ak_wwise_plugin_notifications_object_store_v1 in order to be
 * informed when some inner property set changed.
 * 
 * \aknote
 * 		In order to manage property sets, you must make sure to use \ref AK::Wwise::Plugin::RequestPropertySet in
 * 		your plug-in.
 * \endaknote
 * 
 * \aknote
 * 		Historical naming convention described it as "inner object" and "inner type". For simplicity,
 * 		since we are talking about property sets, the naming has been standardized to "inner property set".
 * 		However, the names are interchangeable and are still being used.
